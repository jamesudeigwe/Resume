        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
        <p>My name is James Udeigwe, but you can call me Oxford. I am a web developer who loves creating websites and apps. I believe that you have to be able to see the big picture when you’re building something, and that’s why I like to work with a team. I am looking to be part of an organization that can offer a unique and fascinating work environment, where my knowledge and skills will be adequately utilized for positive achievements and attainment of organizational goals.</p> <p>You can find me playing video games or watching TV shows when I’m not working on my projects or building excellent new tools for my clients.</p>
